# directory.gov.au Linked Data API

## NOTE: this repository is being updated and is currently non-functional

This repository is the code for the Linked Data API version of <http://directory.gov.au>. It allows persistent URIs for RDF versions of the directory.gov.au content to be served with RDF data.

This API is an implementation of the [pyLDAPI](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/pyldapi), Python Linked Data API, tool which uses RDF data in a triplestore generated by the [directory.gov.au Linked Data generator](https://github.com/AGLDWG/directory.gov.au-ld-generator) tool from the [XML export](https://data.gov.au/dataset/directory-gov-au-export) of directory.gov.au content
